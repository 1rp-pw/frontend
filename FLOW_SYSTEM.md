# Flow System Documentation

The Flow system provides a visual workflow builder for chaining multiple policies together to create complex decision flows. It allows you to build sophisticated business logic by connecting policies in a graph-like structure.

## What is a Flow?

A Flow is a visual representation of a decision-making process that:
- Chains multiple policies together
- Routes data based on policy outcomes
- Handles complex multi-step decision logic
- Provides visual debugging and testing capabilities

Think of a Flow as a flowchart where each node represents either:
- A data input point
- A policy evaluation
- A decision outcome

## Flow vs Policy

### Policy
- A single set of rules evaluating one decision
- Text-based rule definitions
- Returns a single true/false outcome
- Example: "Does this driver qualify for a license?"

### Flow
- Multiple policies connected together
- Visual node-based interface
- Can have multiple paths and outcomes
- Example: "Complete driver application process including eligibility, testing, and license issuance"

## Node Types

### 1. Start Node
- **Purpose**: Entry point of the flow
- **Color**: Green
- **Function**: Receives initial input data
- **Connections**: Can only have outgoing connections
- **Example**: Receives driver application data

```
[Start] → Driver Application Data
```

### 2. Policy Node
- **Purpose**: Evaluates a specific policy
- **Color**: Blue
- **Function**: Runs a policy against input data
- **Properties**:
  - Policy selection
  - Input data mapping
  - Output handling
- **Connections**: 
  - One incoming connection
  - Multiple outgoing connections based on outcomes

```
[Policy: Check Age Requirements]
  ├─ Pass → Continue to next check
  └─ Fail → Reject application
```

### 3. Return Node
- **Purpose**: Terminal node that returns a result
- **Color**: Red (for failure/stop) or Green (for success)
- **Function**: Ends the flow with a specific outcome
- **Properties**:
  - Return value/message
  - Status code
- **Connections**: Only incoming connections

```
[Return: Application Approved] ← Success path
[Return: Application Rejected] ← Failure path
```

### 4. Custom Node
- **Purpose**: Perform custom operations
- **Color**: Purple
- **Function**: Data transformation, external API calls, or custom logic
- **Properties**:
  - Custom code/logic
  - Data transformation rules
- **Example Uses**:
  - Format data for next policy
  - Call external services
  - Perform calculations

```
[Custom: Calculate Risk Score] → Transforms data
```

## Connections and Data Flow

### Edge Types
1. **Default Edge**: Standard connection between nodes
2. **Conditional Edge**: Connection with conditions
3. **Labeled Edge**: Connection with descriptive labels

### Data Passing
- Data flows from node to node through connections
- Each node can transform or enrich the data
- Data accumulates as it flows through the system

```
Start → Policy A → Custom Transform → Policy B → Return
  ↓                                       ↓
  Data: {name}  →  {name, ageOk}  →  {name, ageOk, score}  →  Result
```

## Flow Execution

### Execution Process
1. **Initialization**: Flow starts at the Start node with input data
2. **Sequential Processing**: Each node processes in order
3. **Branching**: Based on outcomes, different paths are taken
4. **Termination**: Flow ends when a Return node is reached

### Execution Modes
- **Test Mode**: Run with test data to verify flow logic
- **Production Mode**: Live execution with real data
- **Debug Mode**: Step-by-step execution with data inspection

### Error Handling
- Nodes can have error paths
- Flows can include retry logic
- Timeout handling for long-running operations

## Use Cases

### 1. Multi-Step Application Process
```
Start → Check Eligibility → Verify Documents → Risk Assessment → Approval Decision
```

### 2. Compliance Checking
```
Start → KYC Check → AML Screening → Sanctions Check → Compliance Decision
```

### 3. Loan Application
```
Start → Credit Check → Income Verification → Risk Calculation → Offer Generation
```

### 4. Insurance Claims
```
Start → Validate Claim → Check Coverage → Calculate Payout → Approve/Reject
```

## Example Flows

### Simple Linear Flow
```
[Start: Application Data]
    ↓
[Policy: Age Verification]
    ↓ (Pass)
[Policy: Document Check]
    ↓ (Pass)
[Return: Approved]
```

### Branching Flow
```
[Start: Loan Application]
    ↓
[Policy: Credit Score Check]
    ├─ High Score → [Policy: Fast Track Approval] → [Return: Approved]
    ├─ Medium Score → [Policy: Manual Review] → [Return: Pending]
    └─ Low Score → [Return: Rejected]
```

### Complex Flow with Custom Logic
```
[Start: Insurance Claim]
    ↓
[Policy: Validate Claim Type]
    ↓ (Valid)
[Custom: Calculate Base Payout]
    ↓
[Policy: Check Fraud Indicators]
    ├─ No Fraud → [Policy: Auto-Approve if < $1000]
    │               ├─ Under Limit → [Return: Auto-Approved]
    │               └─ Over Limit → [Policy: Manual Review]
    └─ Fraud Risk → [Custom: Flag for Investigation] → [Return: Under Review]
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Flow Design
- Keep flows focused on a single business process
- Use descriptive names for nodes and connections
- Document complex logic within custom nodes
- Test each path thoroughly

### 2. Performance
- Minimize the number of nodes
- Avoid circular dependencies
- Cache policy results when possible
- Use parallel execution where appropriate

### 3. Maintenance
- Version your flows
- Keep a changelog of modifications
- Test flows after policy updates
- Monitor flow execution metrics

## Flow Testing

### Test Strategy
1. **Unit Testing**: Test individual policies separately
2. **Path Testing**: Test each possible path through the flow
3. **Integration Testing**: Test with real-world data scenarios
4. **Edge Cases**: Test timeout, error, and exceptional scenarios

### Test Data Management
- Create test datasets for each scenario
- Include positive and negative test cases
- Test boundary conditions
- Maintain test data versioning

## Visual Interface Features

### Canvas Operations
- **Drag & Drop**: Add nodes from the palette
- **Connect**: Draw connections between nodes
- **Pan & Zoom**: Navigate large flows
- **Auto-Layout**: Automatically arrange nodes

### Node Operations
- **Configure**: Set node properties and policies
- **Test**: Run individual nodes with test data
- **Debug**: Inspect node input/output
- **Disable**: Temporarily skip nodes

### Flow Management
- **Save**: Persist flow configuration
- **Version**: Track flow changes
- **Export**: Export as YAML or JSON
- **Import**: Load existing flow definitions

## Technical Details

Flows are stored as JSON/YAML with:
- Node definitions and positions
- Edge connections
- Policy references
- Configuration metadata

- Metrics and monitoring endpoints

## Summary

The Flow system transforms complex business logic into visual, manageable workflows. By combining multiple policies with custom logic and branching, you can model sophisticated decision-making processes while maintaining clarity and testability. The visual nature makes it easy to understand, modify, and debug complex business rules.
